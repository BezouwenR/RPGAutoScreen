# RPG Auto Screen Generator

This is part of my RPG Utils series to help overcome some of the day-to-day activities which can be automated.
During my previous assignments with various companies, I found that there are many static files thats get created during any project.
Initial data is added via SQL or any other method. But the problem arises when we have to modify the data. Now, usually the static files are not maintained by the developer, but by any other team. Now options to them are either SQL or UPDDTA or any other third party tool which in many cases, are error prone.

Imagine you are have a static file with 20, 40, 60 fields. Now developing program for maintainance of this file would take much of your project work time. That is not how we (coders) do the things.

So i present to you a utility that can generate subfiles, programs and all the logic behind the scene withing few mins. Isn't that awesome. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to have AS400 Machine access (duh!)
Create a RPGUtils library to store the files.
```
CRTLIB RPGUTILS
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
